# Governance–License Crosswalk

HHI_GOV_01 governance requirements are enforced through licensing.

## Canonical Relationship
- HHI_GOV_01 defines mandatory governance behavior
- The Hollow House Institute Master License enforces compliance

## Binding Rule
Any use, audit, advisory, derivative work, or deployment that references
HHI_GOV_01 but fails to comply with its requirements constitutes a
license violation.

## Survival Clause
Governance obligations survive:
- Redistribution
- Derivative works
- Format conversion
- Partial extraction

## Enforcement
Failure to preserve governance references, evidence, or authority
controls may trigger termination or remedies under the Master License.

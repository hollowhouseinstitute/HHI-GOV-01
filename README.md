# HHI-GOV-01

HHI-GOV-01 is a public governance standard defining the minimum structural requirements for AI systems to prevent silent behavioral drift over time.

The standard treats governance as infrastructure rather than policy. It specifies enforceable requirements for authority declaration, accountability binding, non-bypassable evidence generation, numerical drift detection, escalation enforcement, and falsifiable proof criteria within defined system boundaries.

HHI-GOV-01 is intended for regulators, auditors, system designers, researchers, and organizations seeking verifiable governance rather than documentation-based compliance.

# Governance Before Agents

Most AI failures are not model failures. They are governance failures.

HHI-GOV-01 defines governance as infrastructure that preserves authority,
accountability, and escalation integrity over time.

## What Makes This Different
- Not ethics
- Not policy
- Not point-in-time audits

This system governs **behavioral accumulation** — how repeated use reshapes
judgment, shortcuts, and responsibility.

## Core Principle
**Time turns behavior into infrastructure.**

This is why governance must precede agents, not follow incidents.

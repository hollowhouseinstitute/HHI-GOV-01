# Governance–License Crosswalk

HHI governance standards are enforced through licensing, not policy alone.

## Relationship
- HHI-GOV-01 defines behavioral governance requirements
- The Master License Suite enforces usage constraints

## Key Principle
Use without governance reference constitutes license violation.

## Effect
Governance obligations survive:
- Redistribution
- Derivative works
- Format conversion

This ensures authority continuity across time and systems.
